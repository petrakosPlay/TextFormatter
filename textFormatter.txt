- perform checks for maxword length and CHARS_PER_LINE
- break it down to functions or multiple c source files
- What happens if i have 2 words and i should put more than one space in between? When would this case occur?
- Fix the printing of the last space at the end of each line.
- Should MAX_WORDS be an input argument??
- When the random text fits in just one line should the line be padded with spaces to reach CHARS_PER_LINE
or simply be printed??

- What happens with the path to the 2 txts for input and output text when i install the app to another PC??
So far the path is pinned down in the code.



gdb32 --args ./textFormatter 103
gcc -Wall -g -o textFormatter textFormatter.c
